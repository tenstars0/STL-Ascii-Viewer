# STL-Ascii-Viewer
A spinning view of an STL file in a terminal  
This is a simple python script that uses curses to make an alternate screen buffer and displays a spinning STL file

This is my ***first*** repo, so if someone sees this please let me know if I should make any changes

## Usage

Make sure that your terminal is large enough else it will error and mess up your terminal, to fix your terminal type `reset` and hit enter, and or resize your terminal screen and run the program again

Create a folder named `gif`

Put the STL object file in the `models` folder

`python3 viewer.py $NAME` Where $NAME is the name of the file in the models folder  

```
mkdir gif
python3 viewer.py heart.stl
```
